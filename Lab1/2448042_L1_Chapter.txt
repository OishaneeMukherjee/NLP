Once upon a time, in a lush forest near a wide river, lived a clever monkey. He resided in a tall, shady jamun tree that grew right on the riverbank.
A crocodile and his wife also made their home in the same forest. One day, the crocodile, feeling tired, rested under the monkey's tree. The kind monkey, seeing 
the crocodile, offered him some sweet, juicy jamuns. The crocodile, delighted with the delicious fruit, returned the next day for more. Soon, the monkey and the 
crocodile became great friends, sharing stories and fruit. 

One day, the crocodile's wife, who had never met the monkey, became envious of their friendship. She heard about the delicious jamuns and decided she wanted 
the monkey's heart, believing it would be as sweet as the fruit. She pressured her husband, the crocodile, to bring her the monkey's heart. Despite his reluctance to 
betray his friend, the crocodile felt compelled to obey his wife. The crocodile invited the monkey for a ride across the river, claiming his wife wanted to meet him. 
The monkey, unable to swim, happily accepted and climbed onto the crocodile's back. As they were crossing the river, the crocodile confessed his true motive. The clever 
monkey, quick on his feet, feigned shock and exclaimed, "Oh no! My heart is left on the jamun tree! We must go back and get it." The foolish crocodile, believing him, 
turned back and carried the monkey back to the tree. Once safely on the bank, the monkey quickly scampered up the tree and away from the crocodile, saving himself.
